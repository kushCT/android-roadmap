This is android roadmap repo
# Steps:
- App with 3 activities which have one button to go to next one.
- Same thing with 3 fragments in one activity
- Check logs for imp lifecycle methods. Understand what is main thread, understand app crash and ANR meaning and try to cause them intentionally.
- 1 input box which takes in number and button next to it to calculate fibonacci number on that position. Print all fib numbers from first to nth fib number (user input).
- Study intent service class - print logs and use it to do something and later on update in UI
- Use coroutines + executor class to download/call api and print the result
- Make basic UI to display list on items (using recyclerview/lazycolumn)
